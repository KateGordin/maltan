                    Clubs acted as a court of appeal to set and maintain standards. They successfully popularized the
                    sport of dog showing and elevated it from venues such as bars and public houses to fashionable
                    locations. Through a kennel club, people could obtain pedigrees for their dogs, which were included
                    on permanent registers. <br>
                    <br>
                    Kennel clubs have had more influence on the development of dog breeds than any other factor since the
                    original diversification of dogs according to function.

            <p>
                My two pups run in that door every time, they love being at Keshlyn. You can tell the staff genuinely
                love what they do and care for each and every dog like they are their own. We love them, they are the
                best in Lexington!!

                Kennel has always done a phenomenal jobs with my dogs. If you have big dogs this is the best value you
                can find. I only go out of town maybe two times a year but they always remember my dogs and exactly
                what they like and don’t.
